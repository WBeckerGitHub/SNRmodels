SNR Modelling Program - version 1.1, January 2019
===================================================
Developed by Dr. Denis Leahy, Bryson Lawton and Jacqueline Williams

Description: A GUI program used to model supernova remnants.
Also attached are a set of animations of hydrodynamic simulations of supernova remnants (animations.zip) and
an animation (dEMdTvsT_n6_12.avi) of the dimensionless Emission Measures and Temperatures for the shocked ISM 
(demF and dtF) and for the shocked ejecta (demR and dtR).
These calculations for these animations are described in the astroph arXiv preprint 1902.08284.

IMPORTANT: The Windows Executable Version is no longer supported.

Python requirements
-------------------

Note: Users are encouraged to use the provided executable file for Windows if
an appropriate version of Python is not already installed.

Python version >= 3.6

Required libraries:
 - NumPy
 - SciPy
 - Matplotlib

The Anaconda distribution of Python (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) comes
with these libraries; however some distributions have a broken version of
Matplotlib. If the program does not run, try uninstalling Matplotlib and 
replacing it using pip.


How to run
----------

For Python version: assuming Python has been added to the PATH, run from the
command line using "python snr.py"

Required files (must remain in the same folder):
 - snr.py
 - snr_calc.py
 - snr_gui.py
 - snr_plot.py
 - data directory (should contain 30 files)


Program usage details
---------------------

Program takes supernova remnant (SNR) properties as user inputs and produces
the following outputs:
 - Values at user-specified time: SNR radius, velocity, electron temperature
 - SNR phase transition times
 - Plots of SNR radius and velocity as functions of time

For some models, an additional set of outputs are produced by clicking the
"Emissivity" button. These outputs include:
 - Emission measure
 - Emission weighted temperature
 - Total luminosity over a user-specified energy range
 - Plots: 
    - Temperature as a function of radius
    - Density as a function of radius
    - Specific intensity as a function of impact parameter
    - Luminosity as a function of energy
    
Abbreviations used:
 - RS: reverse shock
 - ED: ejecta-dominated
 - ST: Sedov-Taylor
 - PDS: pressure-driven snowplow
 - MCS: momentum-conserving shell
 - CISM: Cloudy ISM phase, starts at t_ST (defined in TM99)


Version 1.1 Changes
-----------------------------------
- Time when the reverse shock reaches the core's edge now displayed under transition times
- Time when the reverse shock reaches the center now displayed under transition times
- s=0 case now expanded to address the n=1,9,11,13 cases
- s=0 case constants replaced with more accurate ones
- s=2 case now expanded to address the n= 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 cases
- s=2 case had n=0,1,2,4 cases removed while solutions are improved
- Various fixes with the emissivity button for various models
- Fractional Energy Loss model input fixed
- Standard model data files updated with more accurate structure models from the Chevalier & Parker solutions
- Cloudy ISM model data files updated with more accurate structure models from White & Long solutions
- 5th model type "Sedov-Taylor" with zero ejecta mass added
- Various smaller bug fixes
